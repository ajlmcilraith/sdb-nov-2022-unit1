      <p>
        Aliens are all around us. They take many forms. They have unknown
        agendas. They sometimes take the forms of cats. We do not know why. It
        us possible that aliens enjoy cat food and skritches. This is only
        conjecture, however, as the percentage of cats which are in fact aliens
        is unknown, so the behavior of one cannot be said to be defined in
        reference to the other.

      <p>Aliens are known to share a hatred of <a href="velociraptors.html">velociraptors</a>. </p>
