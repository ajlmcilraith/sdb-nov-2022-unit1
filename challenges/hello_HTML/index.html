      it begins with a cat. a seemingly ordinary animal, yet one which has a strange fondness for certain activities that some might call suspicious.

    <ol>
      <li>They like to knock things off of raised horizontal surfaces, despite the fact that this is only minorly amusing</li>
      <li>They scream to be let outside, yet refuse to move</li>
      <li>They are inconcievably adorable</li>
    </ol>
