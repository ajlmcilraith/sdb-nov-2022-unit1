      <p>Few things in this world are cooler than a velociraptor. But nothing is <strong>cuter</strong> than a kitten. Such is the eternal struggle between velociraptors and cats, forever vying to be the most interesting organism on the planet. Cats have a major foothold on the internet, whole swathes of it being entirely dedicated to the documentation of cats. But velociraptors have persisted in the zeitgeist despite being extinct for (checks notes) up to four hundred years. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Velociraptors have another mortal enemy, that obviously being <a href="aliens.html">Aliens</a>. In fact, relations between the two sets are so identical it as been alleged by some that aliens and cats are actually subsets of the same species. This is 100% true.</p>
